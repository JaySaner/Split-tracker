-- SplitSmart · Hour 6 — groups + membership + multi-tenant Row-Level Security
--
-- HOW TO RUN THIS (after you've already run schema.sql in Hour 5):
--   1. Supabase → left sidebar → SQL Editor → + New query
--   2. Paste everything in this file → Run (Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
--   3. You should see "Success. No rows returned."
--
-- Safe to run more than once.

-- a GROUP is one "tenant" (Goa Trip, Flat 304, ...). join_code lets friends join.
create table if not exists groups (
  id         uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name       text not null,
  join_code  text not null unique default upper(substr(md5(random()::text), 1, 6)),
  created_by uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- who belongs to which group
create table if not exists group_members (
  group_id  uuid not null references groups(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id   uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  joined_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (group_id, user_id)
);

-- every expense now belongs to a group
alter table expenses add column if not exists group_id uuid references groups(id) on delete cascade;

-- helper: "is the logged-in person a member of this group?"
-- SECURITY DEFINER lets it check membership WITHOUT tripping RLS recursion.

set search_path = public as $$
  select exists (select 1 from group_members
                 where group_id = gid and user_id = auth.uid());

create or replace function join_group(code text)
returns uuid language plpgsql security definer
set search_path = public as $$

    on conflict do nothing;
  return gid;

-- turn on Row-Level Security, then the rules (safe to re-run)
